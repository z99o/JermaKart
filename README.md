# JermaKart  README
 
JermaKart is a jerma985 fan game made in Unity.
The compiled game can be found here: https://sadclowngames.itch.io/jermakart

This codebase will likely not compile, as it would take time and possibly Github LTS to get all the assets in order, present
is the project structure minus all the 3rd party assets that were imported and subsequently bloated the project. If you would like a compilable source zip file please contact more|lloz|@|protonmail|.|com (Remove Pipes |).

The Assets/Scripts folder contains all the code made for the game
